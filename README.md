# Sales-Performance-and-Customer-Insights
This project focuses on developing an interactive and insight-driven Sales Performance & Customer Insights Dashboard using Power BI to analyze and summarize large-scale sales data effectively. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of business performance by tracking key metrics such as total sales, total profit, monthly profit trends, and category-wise sales distribution. It enables detailed analysis of profit contribution across sub-categories, helping identify high-performing and underperforming product segments.
Customer behavior is analyzed by identifying the top five buyers based on sales value and examining their geographic distribution across states using map visualizations. This helps in understanding regional demand patterns and key revenue-generating customers. The dashboard also evaluates sales performance by payment mode, offering insights into customer purchasing preferences and transaction trends.
